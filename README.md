# Heart_deasese_prediction
Developed a professional ML-based web application to predict heart disease risk from user-input medical data. Utilized Python, Flask, scikit-learn, and Pickle for model training (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest), serialization, and seamless deployment via a user-friendly web interface.

### Motivation

As being a Data and ML enthusiast I have tried many different projects related to the subject but what I have realised is that Deploying your machine learning model is a key aspect of every ML and Data science project. Everything thing I had studied or been taught so far in my Data science and ML journey had mostly focused on defining problem statement followed by Data collection and preparation, model building and evaluation process which is of course important for every ML/DS project but what if I want different people to interact with my models, how can I make my model available for end-users? I can't send them jupyter notebooks right!. That's why I wanted to try my hands on complete end-to-end machine learning project.
